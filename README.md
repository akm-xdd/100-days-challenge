# 100-days-challenge

My 100 days journey of learning Web Development.
I will upload my weekly progress in the repo.

This challenge does not represent my knowledge in the field of Web Development, rather just a journey in learning MEVN stack from 0 to 100 in 100 days or under.
I have taken this challenge to keep up and add to my existing knowledge every week.

Current Goal: Do my module uploads on time


Updates: The challenge is almost at midway. I became irregular due to end semester exams. Day 1 to 39 was hell of a ride. From Day 39-47, I learned core Javascript and Bootstrap. From day 48, I am onwards to backend development for a while.

How to use? Download individual folders rather than the entire repo. Open in VS Code. Go Live and start editing
