# 100-days-challenge

My 100 days journey of learning Web Development.
I will upload my weekly progress in the repo.

This challenge does not represent my knowledge in the field of Web Development, rather just a journey in learning MEVN stack from 0 to 100 in 100 days or under.
I have taken this challenge to keep up and add to my existing knowledge every week.


Current Goal: Do my weekly uploads on time
